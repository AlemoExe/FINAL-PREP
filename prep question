'''
Define an abstract class called Vehicle  with the abc module. The class should have a constructor that makes a model, and year. It should also have
	•	An abstract method rent_cost(days)
	•	A method details(the_status=False) that prints the basic vehicle info and includes if being used or not(base case is no)
Use the ABC base class and @abstractmethod appropriately.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicule(ABC):
	def __init__(self, model, year):
		self.model = model
		self.year = year
	@abstractmethod
	def rental_cost(self, days):
		pass
	def details(self, status = False):
		details = f"{self.model} {self.year}"
		if status:
			details += "Available"
		print(details)
